# facerecognition
1.Dataset creator
Creation of Dataset which can  store Real time  Faces. By executing this module, we can capture different frames which is happening before the Camera .Here, the Faces in every Captured frame is recognized in a form of dimensional array normal(3 dimensional) ,Grey(2 dimensional) to the assigned id.

2.Trainer

Our aim is to Detect or Recognize the faces from the above created Data set. So, we have to train the system with all the photos or faces and their respective  id values which are useful to recognize names of the faces.

3.Recognition
After executing the program ,camera opens and recognizes the faces before them by validating the faces with their ids and their dimensional arrays .If it recognizes the faces from the dataset then it shows names of all respective Faces.
